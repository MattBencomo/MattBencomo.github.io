          Daxko Operations is a member management SaaS web application built for the nonprofit market. Being one of
          their oldest products, Operations is built on a mix of C#, .NET, Webforms, MVC, and React.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of Daxko's nonprofit team, I contributed to efforts to expand functionality and modernize some of
          the older Webforms pages. I also worked directly with our UX team to bring our Figma template and our
          component library back into sync.

        <p>
          CMPro is an internally built CRM web application using Angular, C#, and .NET Framework to make it easier for
          the
          sales department to manage customer relations. When a customer calls, a notification (desktop or toast
          message) directs the sales representative to the customer's account giving them access to account details,
          order history, trends, and suggest products for a new order.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of Kretek's software team I supported CMPro development, worked with users to resolve defects,
          maintained reporting tools, and built solutions for various small projects.

          Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Application Online is an internally built web application using Webforms and
          .NET Framework to monitor groundwater extractions and bill customers for usage beyond their allocation. The
          site has a customer facing side for allowing users to submit meter readings, view and pay statements, and edit
          their account information. There is also an administrative side for viewing reports and managing customers,
          users, permissions, and statement periods.

          As a member of the County of Ventura IT Services Web Development team, I was assigned to be the product owner,

          gather requirements for enhancements and discuss design changes

            ATIMS Online (V1 & V2)

        <p>
          ATIMS Online (V1) is a Jail Management Software SaaS web application built for public sector Sherriff and
          Police Department jails. Being a rewrite of an older windows client written in Winforms, ATIMS Online (V1) was
          written using Visual Basic, .NET Framework, and Webforms. ATIMS Online (V2) is a full rewrite of V1 using
          Angular 2+, C#, .NET Core, and Entity Framework Core.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of the Product Development team at ATIMS, I went through many roles. Originally I was brought on
          to write Crystal Report templates to satisfy acceptance criteria of a new client. This role gave me initial
          experience writing a large number of SQL queries ranging from simple data retrieval to complex statistics
          collection. Eventually I learned Visual Basic, .NET, and Webforms and started fixing bugs I found around the
          generation of the reports I was writing. Once I had completed the necessary reports to satisfy the clients
          acceptance criteria and had proved myself as a capable software developer, I was officially promoted and
          started working on enhancements and bug tickets. Our product had more features than any of our competitors,
          but we had one major flaw, it was very slow. Our Director of Engineering decided the time it would take to
          tune everything to improve speed would be better spent rewriting using the latest technology. My team and I
          got to work learning Angular2, .NET Core, and Entity Framework Core and started writing our first module of
          V2.
